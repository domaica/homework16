          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h6>By selecting different axes in the above chart, you can compare data types to get the values used for the analysis below:</h6>
          <hr>
          <h4>Poverty vs Healthcare.  Correlation = 0.5245</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">Positive or linear correlation. As poverty increases, there is a bigger % of population with lack of healthcare.
            Correlation is slightly above 0.5, therefore we can conclude that it implies a moderate correlation between poverty and 
            lack of healthcare in different US states.
          </p>
          <h4>Poverty vs Obesity.  Correlation = 0.4623</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">There is a linear correlation positive. It means that when poverty increases, so does the obesity.
            Anyway, it is a weak correlation as value is smaller than 0.5.
            
          </p>
          <h4>Poverty vs Smoking.  Correlation = 0.5208</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">As poverty increases, there is a bigger amount of smokers. Correlation is slightly above 0.5 so the interpretation for this 
            implies a moderate correlation between poverty and smoking.
          </p>
          <h4>Age vs Obesity.  Correlation = -0.0077</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">The correlation value is so close to zero that it can be considered that there is no correlation between these 2 factors.
           
          </p>
          <h4>Age vs Smoking.  Correlation = 0.2481</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">As age increases there is a trend towards increasing smoking, 
            but correlation value is aproximately 0.25 so the correlation is weak.
          
          </p>
          <h4>Age vs Healthcare.  Correlation = -0.3852</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">This correlation value is negative or non linear what implies that as one factor (age) increases, 
            the other (Healthcare) decreases, but it is a weak trend again.
            </p>
          <h4>Household Income vs Obesity.  Correlation = -0.6511</h4>
          <p style="margin-left:25px">This correlation value is negative or non linear what implies that as one factor (household income) increases, 
            the other (obesity) decreases.
            In addition to that, correlation is a value close to -0.7 and bigger than -0.5, so we can conclude that there is a moderate, 
            almost strong negative correlation between income and obesity.
            The bigger the income, obesity decreases.
          </p>
        <!-- </p> -->
        <h4>Household Income vs Smoking.  Correlation = -0.6601</h4>
        <p style="margin-left:25px">Same as above. Negative correlation between income and smoking. 
          The bigger the household income in a given US State, residents there tend to smoke less.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h4>Household Income vs Healthcare.  Correlation = -0.4340</h4>
      <p style="margin-left:25px">As household income increases, there are less state residents who lack healthcare. Negative correlation is moderate.
